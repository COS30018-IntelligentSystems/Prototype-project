# T1573 - Encrypted Channel

**Matrix:** Enterprise

**Tactics:** Command and Control

## Description

Adversaries may employ an encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.

## Platforms

ESXi, Linux, Network Devices, Windows, macOS
